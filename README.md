# JavaScript Error Remover

## Disclaimer

**Disclaimer: This project is intended for humor purposes only and should never be used in production or to harm anyone or their data. Please use it responsibly and at your own risk.**

The **JavaScript Error Remover** automatically deletes entire JavaScript files upon finding errors. Use this tool with extreme caution and make sure to back up your files before running it to prevent data loss.

The tool uses basic error detection techniques and may not catch all errors, especially those that occur dynamically during runtime. Always review the results carefully and consider fixing errors manually whenever possible.

The **JavaScript Error Remover** is a tongue-in-cheek command-line tool that claims to help you identify and remove JavaScript errors from a given JavaScript file. The "removal" of errors in this context is done by taking a comedic approach.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Node.js

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. If not, you can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install click
   ```

3. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org

## Usage

To use the **JavaScript Error Remover**, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the script.

4. Run the script with the path to your JavaScript file as the argument:

   ```bash
   python remove_js_errors.py <path_to_your_javascript_file>
   ```

   Replace `<path_to_your_javascript_file>` with the actual path to the JavaScript file you want to process.

## How It Works

1. The CLI tool reads the content of the provided JavaScript file.

2. It uses Node.js to execute the JavaScript code.

3. If any errors are found during execution, the tool will display a message indicating that errors were found.

4. If errors are found, it will delete the entire JavaScript file.

   **Note:** The file deletion is permanent, and the deleted file cannot be recovered. Always have a backup of your files before running the script.

5. If no errors are found, it will display a message indicating that no errors were detected.

## Example

Suppose you have a JavaScript file named `script.js` with the following code:

```javascript
if (foo {
    bar += 1;
}
```

Running the JavaScript Error Remover on this file:

```bash
python remove_js_errors.py script.js
```

The output will be:

```
JavaScript error(s) found in the file. Deleting the file...
File 'script.js' deleted.
```

As the provided JavaScript code has a syntax error, the tool detects the error, displays the message about the error, and then deletes the `script.js` file.
